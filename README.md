# SpaceX Rocket Predictions
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical SpaceX launch data to predict the success of rocket landings using data science and machine learning techniques. By leveraging data from past missions, the project aims to uncover patterns and build a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of successful recovery based on various mission parameters such as payload mass, launch site, orbit type, and booster version.
## Objectives
Most of the Space Related Organizations cost a lot more finance to send their rockets into the earth's orbit like around 165 mil, whereas the rockets by SpaceX only costs 65mil we find the reason to that in this project.
